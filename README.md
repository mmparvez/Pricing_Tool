## Product Price and Shipment Cost Tracker
This project is a SQLite3 database application to record product price changes and shipment costs. It includes a GUI interface for easy interaction and can be converted into an executable file for Windows.

## Steps
1. **Database Design**
  
    We'll start with designing the database. Below is an image of the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for our database.

2. **Generating Schema to Create Tables**

    Next, we'll generate the schema to create the necessary tables. Here's an image of the SQL schema.

3. **Insert Some Data in the Tables**

    We'll insert some sample data into the tables. This step will also be represented by an image of the SQL commands used.

4. **Generating a GUI Interface to Interact with the Database**

    We'll create a GUI interface to interact with the database. Below is an image of the GUI.
